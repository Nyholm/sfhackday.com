                        The Symfony hackday is a day where we gather in the same room, meet each other & contribute to open source code.
                        Everybody is welcome: it does not matter if you've never contributed before or if you consider yourself
                        an expert in open source software.

                        If you dont have any ideas yourself, there are plenty of issues you can pick from. We've composed a long list
                        in <b><a href="javascript:void(0)">this spreadsheet</a></b>. When you start with a task,
                        please mark it as claimed so no two people are working on the same thing without knowing.

                        The main focus will be to make libraries ready for Symfony 5.0. Most of the time this means just updating
                        that library's <i>composer.json</i> file. But you need to carefully read the changelog of the symfony
                        components used to make sure we are not breaking anything. (Or, ignore the changelog and hope the
                        library/bundle is tested - watch to see if the tests pass in your pull request!).

                    <p class="is-size-5">
                        There will also be "theme tables" where people get together to work on a specific component or library.
                        There will be a Messenger table, Webpack, PHPUnit, Doctrine, API Platform and more.
