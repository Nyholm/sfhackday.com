            <h1>Symfony Hackday</h1>
            <p>
                The Symfony hackday is a day where we gather in the same room, meet each other & contribute to open source code.
                Everybody is welcome: it does not matter if you've never contributed before or if you consider yourself
                an expert in open source software.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next Symfony hackday is on <b>Saturday 2019-11-23</b> in Amsterdam after <a href="https://amsterdam2019.symfony.com">Symfony Con</a>.
                <br>
                <b>Venue:</b> De Bazel, Vijzelstraat 32
            </p>

            <h2>What should we do?</h2>
            <p>
                The short answer is: Whatever you want.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don't have any ideas yourself, there are plenty of issues you can pick from. We've composed a long list
                in <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18H-6gY88M0G-kaKTEk_ZyPeYqvYr63gzBbopHyOppK0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this spreadsheet</a></b>. When you start with a task,
                please mark it as claimed so no two people are working on the same thing without knowing.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main focus will be to make libraries ready for Symfony 5.0. Most of the time this means just updating
                that library's <i>composer.json</i> file. But you need to carefully read the changelog of the Symfony
                components used to make sure we are not breaking anything. (Or, ignore the changelog and hope the
                library/bundle is tested - watch to see if the tests pass in your pull request!).
            </p>

            <p>
                There will also be "theme tables" where people get together to work on a specific component or library.
                There will be a Messenger table, Webpack, PHPUnit, Doctrine, API Platform and more.
            </p>


            <h2>Make it count</h2>
            <p>
                Whenever you make a PR or Issue on GitHub, please add <b>#SymfonyHackday</b> in the description. Then we
                can count the contributions!
            </p>


            <h2>Schedule</h2>

            <p>
                We open the doors around 09:30. Bring your computer to start coding, helping others or discussing
                issues. At <b>10:00</b> we will start a workshop titled "How to start contributing to open source".
            </p>
            <p>
                We will continue contributing until around 17:00. Nobody is expected to participate for the
                full day - you can come and go as you please!
            </p>

            <h2>Speaker training</h2>
            <p>
                If you are interested in speaking in public, there will be a speaker training at the same time
                as the Hackday. We will start at 10:00 and during the day we will discuss about submitting talk ideas,
                writing a bio, how to write slides etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will end the day around 16:00.
