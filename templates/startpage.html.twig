        <h1>Symfony Hackday</h1>

        <p>
            The Symfony hackday is a day where we gather in the same room, meet each other & contribute to open source code.
            Everybody is welcome: it does not matter if you've never contributed before or if you consider yourself
            an expert in open source software.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next Symfony hackday is <b>Saturday 2019-11-23</b> in Amsterdam after <a href="https://amsterdam2019.symfony.com">Symfony Con</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>What should we do?</h2>
        <p>
            The short anwser is: Whatever you want.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you dont have any ideas yourself, there are plenty of issues you can pick from. We've composed a long list
            in <b><a href="javascript:void(0)">this spreadsheet</a></b>. When you start with a task,
            please mark it as claimed so no two people are working on the same thing without knowing.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main focus will be to make libraries ready for Symfony 5.0. Most of the time this means just updating
            that library's <i>composer.json</i> file. But you need to carefully read the changelog of the symfony
            components used to make sure we are not breaking anything. (Or, ignore the changelog and hope the
            library/bundle is tested - watch to see if the tests pass in your pull request!).
        </p>

        <p>
            There will also be "theme tables" where people get together to work on a specific component or library.
            There will be a Messenger table, Webpack, PHPUnit, API Platform and more.
        </p>


        <h2>Make it count</h2>
        <p>
            Whenever you make a PR or Issue on Github, please add <b>#SyfmonyHackday</b> in the description. Then we
            can count the contributions!
        </p>


        <h2>Schedule</h2>

        <p>
            We open the doors around 09.30. Bring your computer to start coding, helping others or discussing
            issues. At <b>10.00</b> we will start a workshop titled "How do start contributing to open source".
        </p>
        <p>
            We will continue contributing until around 17.00. Nobody is expected to participate for the
            full day - you can come and go as you please!
        </p>
