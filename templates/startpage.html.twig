            <h1>Symfony Hackday</h1>
            <p>
                The Symfony hackday is a day where we gather in the same room, meet each other & contribute to open source code.
                Everybody is welcome: it does not matter if you've never contributed before or if you consider yourself
                an expert in open source software.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next Symfony hackday is on <b>Saturday 2020-12-05</b> on Slack after <a href="https://live.symfony.com/2020-world/">Symfony World</a>.
                <br>
                <b>Venue:</b> #hackday on <a href="https://symfony.com/slack">Symfony slack</a>
            </p>

            <h2>What should we do?</h2>
            <p>
                The short answer is: Whatever you want. If you want to have some
                inspiration or ideas, see the following focus groups.
            </p>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <p>
                There is a lot of new features in Symfony 5.2 and some of them
                have not been documented yet. See <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/milestone/23">the issues in the 5.2 milestone</a>
                to find things to do. When start working with an issue, try to
                see if the feature requires documentation or if the issue should
                be closed. You may find the <a href="https://symfony.com/blog/category/living-on-the-edge">Symfony blog posts</a>
                helpful.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are also a few features introduced in Symfony 5.1 that are
                missing documentation. See <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/milestone/23">the issues in the 5.1 milestone</a>.
                These has been stalled because they don't need documentation or
                because it may be complicated to write the documentation. For
                each of these issues and PRs, please write a comment if you think
                it should be closed or if they should be done. When a few people
                given their opinion, it will be easier for a maintainer to take a
                decision.
            </p>

            <p>
                Feel free to create a PR for an issue if you want to.
            </p>

            <h4>Reproduce bugs</h4>
            <p>
                One thing that is super helpful for maintainers is reproducing bugs.
                It is way easier to resolve a bug report with a code example and
                that is verified by someone.
            </p>

            <p>
                Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABug">open bug reports</a>,
                try to understand and reproduce the bugs. Make a comment like
                "Status: Reviewed" (if you can reproduce) or "Status: Works for me". Also explain what you have tried,
                maybe add some code example or maybe event a link to a new test repository.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the bug was verified and you want to walk the extra mile,
                you can also try fixing it. Ask in Slack for help.
            </p>

            <h4>Review open PRs</h4>
            <p>
                If you really want a challenge, go through the <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Status%3A+Needs+Review%22">open PRs</a>
                and review them. Make a comment about what you like and what could
                be improved. Maybe event test the PR to make sure it works. Then try
                to figure out why the PR is still open.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does it need a decision for the Core Team?</li>
                <li>Does it need more work? If the PR has been stalled for a long time, maybe you want to finish it?</li>
                <li>If it is not clear why it is stalled, make sure to submit a Github review with "Approve" or "Request changes"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>How to checkout someone else's PR?</p>
            <p>After <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/pull_requests.html#step-2-setup-your-environment">setting up</a> Symfony on your PC. You can use the following git commands to checkout a PR (in this case number 38920) locally:</p>
            <code><pre>
git fetch upstream pull/38920/head:pr-38920
git checkout pr-38920
            </pre></code>

            <p>See <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/community/reviews.html">Community Reviews</a> for more information.</p>

            <h4>Tell us about testing</h4>
            <p>
                TODO
            </p>
            <h4>Write a blog post</h4>
            <p>
                An absolutely awesome way to contribute to Symfony is to write a
                blog post where you share an idea or describe how you solved a problem.
                Even if a problem is very specific, it will still be helpful for
                some people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blog posts differs from the Symfony documentation because they can
                be opinionated. There are sometimes more than one way to solve a
                problem and none is "the best". The documentation is also very restrictive
                what libraries to recommend.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you write a blog post, make sure to share it in the #posts channel
                on Symfony slack and any other social media.
                This will increase your reads and maybe even make it a featured
                in "A Week of Symfony".
            </p>

            <h4>Something else</h4>
            <p>
                Work on your own project or a pull request of your choosing. Ask
                for help or discussion on slack now when there are a lot of people
                active.
            </p>
